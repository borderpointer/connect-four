# Connect Four

## Built With

• HTML <br>
• CSS <br>
• JS <br>

## Synopsis

A simple connect four game built with HTML, CSS, and JS. The user has options of playing with another player, or with a basic AI that makes random moves.

## Motivation

This game was built to practice HTML, CSS, and JS, and to improve problem solving skills and consistent logical thinking.

## Installation

Demo of this game can be found <a href="http://borderpointer.github.io/connect-four/" target = "_blank">here</a>.

## Unsolved Problems

#### There are some isolated use cases that cause:

• A win to be not detected when there are five consecutively same colored chips, instead of four.

## Future Improvements

#### I want to:

• Make the AI smarter so that it actively blocks the player from winning. <br>
• Keep track and display each player's wins. <br>
• Add the ability to store a game to play later, using Firebase, local storage, or similar. <br>
• Add the ability to play live with another person remotely, using Firebase or similar.
